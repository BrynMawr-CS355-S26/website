=== Attendance and participation

Lab and lecture attendance is mandatory. Both will have graded activities.
Missing one or two class meetings is not a problem. Arrangements can be made in
advance if you need to miss an important activity, such as a midterm. Valid 
reasons to miss class include conference travel and family emergencies. Job interviews and 
other appointments are not valid reasons for absence: schedule this around your class commitments.

<p><em>Assignment by Dianna Xu</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this project, you will implement a memory allocator for the heap of a user-level process. In
other words, you will build your own version of malloc() and free(). You will implement this as
a dynamically linked library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Memory allocators have two distinct tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the memory allocator asks the operating system to
expand the heap portion of the process’s address space by calling either sbrk() or mmap().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the memory allocator doles out this memory to the calling process. This involves managing the
free list of memory and finding a contiguous chunk of memory that is large enough for the user’s
request; when the user later frees memory, it is added back to this list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The memory allocator is usually provided as part of a standard library and is not part of the OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be clear, the memory allocator operates entirely within the virtual address space of a single
process and knows nothing about which physical pages have been allocated to this process or the
mapping from logical addresses to physical addresses. Although only a small subset of what the OS
does in terms of memory management, this project should still provide good insights into memory
allocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_requesting_memory">Requesting Memory</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although a real memory allocator requests more memory from the OS whenever it
cannot satisfy a request from the user (for example, typical implementation of malloc calls
sbrk repeatedly and manages each chunk returned by sbrk), we simplify the implementation
by asking that your memory allocator call mmap() only one time in <code>Mem_Init</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_interface">Interface</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interface to the memory allocation library has been created for you. You
will write your own implementation of this interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>int Mem_Init(long sizeOfRegion)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mem_Init is called one time by a process using your routines. <code>sizeOfRegion</code> is the
number of bytes you should request from the OS using <code>mmap</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you may need to round this amount so that you request memory in units of
the page size (see the man page for getpagesize). Note also that you need to use this
allocated memory for your own data structures as well; that is, your infrastructure for
tracking the mapping from addresses to memory objects has to be placed in this region.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Return value: Upon success (when the call to mmap is succesful), Mem_Init returns 0.
Upon failure, Mem_Init should return −1 and set m_error to E_BAD_ARGS. Along with
mmap failing, there are a few other cases where Mem_Init should return a failure:
Along with mmap failing, there are a few other cases where Mem_Init should return a failure:
<code>Mem_Init</code> is called more than once; <code>sizeOfRegion</code> is less than or equal to 0, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>void *Mem_Alloc(long size)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Mem_Alloc</code> takes as input the size in bytes of the object to be allocated and returns a
pointer to the start of that object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your allocator should use a Worst Fit (WF) policy to decide which chunk of free space
to hand out; WF simply looks through your free list and finds the free space that is
largest in size and returns the requested size to the user, keeping the rest of the chunk
in its free list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For performance reasons, <code>Mem_Alloc</code> should return 8-byte aligned chunks of memory. For
example, if a user allocates 1 byte of memory, your Mem_Alloc implementation should
return 8 bytes of memory so that the next free block will be 8-byte aligned, too. To
figure out whether you return 8-byte aligned pointers, you should print the pointer out
with printf("%p", ptr) The last digit should be a multiple of 8 (i.e., 0 or 8).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Return value: Upon success, Mem_Alloc returns a pointer to the start of the object. The
function returns NULL if there is not enough contiguous free space within sizeOfRegion
allocated by Mem_Init to satisfy this request (and sets m_error to E_NO_SPACE).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>int Mem_Free(void *ptr, int coalesce)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Mem_Free</code> frees the memory object that ptr points to. Just like the standard free(),
if ptr is NULL, then no operation is performed. The coalesce flag determines whether
the Mem_Free routine should coalesce the freed space back into the bigger pool. Note
that in the case of Mem_Free(NULL,1), you should still coalesce, even though you have
not freed any memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Coalescing</strong>: Coalescing rejoins neighboring freed blocks into one bigger free chunk, thus
ensuring that big chunks remain free for subsequent calls to Mem_Alloc. When coalesce
is non-zero, Mem_Free will coalesce free space; specifically, when coalesce is 1, coalesce
the entire list and coalesce wherever possible; when coalesce is 2, coalesce a local
neighberhood whose size is upto you. If the coalesce flag is 0, no such coalescing should be
done; this makes Mem_Free faster, but leaves small fragments in the free space. Note
that in this setup, 0 is the fastest, 1 is the slowest, and 2 is inbetween, depending on
how you optimize.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Return value: Upon success, Mem_Free should return 0; on failure, it should return −1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>void Mem_Dump()</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a debugging routine for your own use. Have it print the regions of free
memory to the screen. For those of you who know how to generate PPM images, you can also
visualize used vs. empty memory with an image.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_design">Design</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure you spend time pondering the design of your memory allocator. In other words:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>What are you putting into those 32-byte headers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are you putting the headers and how are you going to organize those headers (note that the important thing is you are limited to 32 bytes per block. You are not limited to the “header” name. In other words, you can put it before, after (which makes them footers), as well as before AND after (you will have to split the 32 bytes then, of course)) . How are your data structures embedded and organized through the headers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many lists? Singly or doubly or something else?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, the answers to the above questions are intertwined because what you wish to keep
in the headers will depend on how you wish to organize them and through them, your lists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you think you have a design, I strongly advice you to do some drawings to better under-
stand what is going on. Which bytes need to be updated when merging two blocks, three blocks,
more blocks? What happens when a block is split (on allocation)?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_testing">Testing</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
